Machine Learning in Action 
==========================

This is a fork of the source code to go with "Machine Learning in Action" by Peter Harrington published by Manning Inc.

As I went through the book, I rewrote the code. Major differences include the incorporation of python pandas, changes in code styling, and further documentation. 

Feel free to fork the code.
